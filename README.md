# UserActivityTracker
UserActivityInsight is a Python tool that tracks user activity via system logs and webcam input. It monitors windows, keystrokes, clicks, gaze, and hand movement, then auto-generates a detailed report. Each feature is modular, with a combined script and Gemini Pro integration for smart summaries.
